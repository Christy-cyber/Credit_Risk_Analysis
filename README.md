# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview and Purpose
Credit risk can be difficult to predict due to unbalanced classes because the number of good loans typically outweighs the number of risky loans.  The purpose of this project was to apply different machine learning algorithms and models from the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to resample data in order to determine which  produces the best outcomes based on the balanced accuracy score, precision score, and recall score for each.  The following were used: 

Oversampling was performed using:
- Random Over Sampler
- SMOTE

Undersampling was performed using:
- Cluster Centroids

Combination of over- and undersampling was perfomed using:
- SMOTEENN

Two models that reduce bias were performed using:
- Balanced Random Forest Classifier
- Easy Ensemble Classifier
